# Bitrii

A free, open source, low barrier to entry, pixel art game engine for creating games that run in one HTML file.

**Why one file?** Single file games are easy to share and host online.

**Why HTML?** The games and engine are written in JavaScript, but are wrapped in an HTML file so they can be opened in web browsers by double-clicking. Also, games can be run on all computers and operating systems without additional effort on the part of game devs.
