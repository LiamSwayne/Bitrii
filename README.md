A free, open source, low barrier to entry, pixel art game engine for creating games that run in one HTML file.

**Why one file?** Single file games are easy to share and host online.

**Why HTML?** The games and engine are written in JavaScript, but are wrapped in an HTML file so they can be opened in web browsers by double-clicking. Also, games can be run on all computers and operating systems without additional effort on the part of game devs.

Roadmap:
- [ ] Layer system.
  - [ ] Base layer system.
  - [ ] Collision syntax.
  - [ ] Outline layers.<details><summary></summary>Layers that are dynamic outlines of other layers.</details>
- [ ] IP address-based security feature for paid games.<details><summary></summary>To prevent piracy, downloads will be configured to only run on the downloader's IP address. This feature will be disabled by default, but can be enabled for paid software.</details>
