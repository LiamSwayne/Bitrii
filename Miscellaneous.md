# Miscellaneous notes

In the context of a game using the current background system, a background with a slight decrease in opacity (#000000f6 for example) could be a very effective form of detecting splices in speedruns. The color of certain pixels in each frame would be directly influenced by the previous frame. This detection method would make splicing runs much more difficult without impacting players or the game's performance significantly.
